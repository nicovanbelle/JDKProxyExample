# JDKProxyExample

### Reason for the project
To show anyone how JDK (dynamic) proxies can be used to add behavior to objects.
In a Spring application these proxies will generally be created in a BeanPostProcessor (BPP).


### Technicalities
Required Maven for slf4j dependencies and at lease Java 14 (build with Java 18) as it uses records.
